<longdescription>A fast XML parser and object serializer that uses only standard
C lib. Optimized XML (Ox), as the name implies, was written to provide
speed-optimized XML handling. It was designed to be an alternative to Nokogiri
and other Ruby XML parsers for generic XML parsing and as an alternative to
Marshal for Object serialization.</longdescription>
