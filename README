About Ruby-Vroom
================

I am learning my way around the Gentoo distro and Gentoo development.  I've
noticed that the Ruby offerings in Gentoo are seriously out of date at this
writing.

I've created the ruby-vroom overlay to expose my experiments in updating
Gentoo's Ruby software.

You are welcome to use the contents of this overlay as you like. But beware:
it is highly experimental and not intended to be stable!

How to Use With Layman
======================

If you want to use this overlay (you're kidding, right?) with the help of
layman, here's what you can do:

1. Add this URL to your layman config's overlays section:
	https://raw.github.com/L2G/gentoo_ruby-vroom/master/repo.xml
2. Run:
	layman -S
	layman -a ruby-vroom

That's it.
