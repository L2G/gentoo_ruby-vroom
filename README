I am learning my way around the Gentoo distro and Gentoo development.  I've
noticed that the Ruby offerings in Gentoo are seriously out of date at this
writing.

I've created the ruby-vroom overlay to expose my experiments in updating
Gentoo's Ruby software.

You are welcome to use the contents of this overlay as you like. But beware:
it is highly experimental and not intended to be stable!
